                <p>Years ago, I wondered how to expand a ministry of encouragement. I was given the chance to spend an hour with Dick Halverson, who was then the Chaplain of the U.S. Senate. When I asked him about that wondering, he told me the story of his weekly one-page letter “Perspective” that he began mailing once a week to forty-five members of his congregation. That number grew into the tens of thousands, all before email!</p>
                <p>With his encouragement, Building One Another was born — first as a letter, and then as an e-devotional. Now we are adding the podcast dimension too that we may expand and elaborate on the topic of the week. We pray you will enjoy them both!</p>
